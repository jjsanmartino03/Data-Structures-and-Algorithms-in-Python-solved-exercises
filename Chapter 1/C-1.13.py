###Write a pseudo-code description of a function that reverses a list of n
#integers, so that the numbers are listed in the opposite order than they
#were before, and compare this method to an equivalent Python function
#for doing the same thing.

#1.return a list of the given list but inversely looped

data = [2, 73, 5, 89]
#data.reverse()
print(data[::-1])
