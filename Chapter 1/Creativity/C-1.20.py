"""
C-1.20 
Pythonâ€™s random module includes a function shuffle(data) that accepts a list of elements
and randomly reorders the elements so that each possible order occurs with equal probability.
The random module includes a more basic function randint(a, b) that returns a uniformly
random integer from a to b (including both endpoints). Using only the randint function,
implement your own version of the shuffle function.
