    "# 2 Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "## 2.1 Goals, Principles and Patterns\n",
    "- **Objects** are **instances** of classes. Each instance has **member** variables and **member** functions\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Object-Oriented design goals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Robustness\n",
    "- Software capable of _handling unexpected inputs_ that are not **explicitly defined** for its application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaptability\n",
    "- Means being able to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment.\n",
    "- _Portability_\n",
    "  - Be able to run in different hardware with minimal changes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reusability\n",
    "- Software usable in different systems in different applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Object-Oriented design principles\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modularity\n",
    "- The concept of dividing a system into different functional units.\n",
    "- Useful to _robustness_ , because a system can be tested in separated parts, and it is possible to trace down any error.\n",
    "- Useful also to _reusability_ , because you can use distinct units in differents parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstraction\n",
    "- To describe the _most fundamental_ parts of a program\n",
    "- ADTs (__Abstract Data Types__)\n",
    "  - An ADT is a _mathematical model of a data_ structure that specifies the type of data stored, the operations supported on them, and the types of parameters of the operations.\n",
    "  - It specifies the **what** but not the **how**\n",
    "- __Duck typing__\n",
    "  - As python is a **dinamically typed** (variables haven't an esclusive type) and **interpreted** (not compiled) language, programmers _assume_ that an object supports a set of **known behaviors**, with the interpreter raising a run-time error if those assumptions fail\n",
    "- Python supports **ABCs** (abstract base classes)\n",
    "  - An ABC can't be instantiated, but it provides the primitive structure to create other **classes based on it**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "- Other people should not know or make any changes to the internal functioning of a data type, but only interact with the **public interface**.\n",
    "- In that way, programmers can do whatever the want to the inner functionality, **as long as they keep the public interface unchanged**\n",
    "- It makes **robustness and adaptability** a lot easier\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.3 Design patterns\n",
    "- Design patterns are solutions to problems that can be used in many different situations\n",
    "  - It has a **name**, a **context** (where to use it), and a **context**, how to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Software Development\n",
    "- Software development process:\n",
    "  - **Design**\n",
    "  - **Implementation**\n",
    "  - **Test and debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Design\n",
    "- How to organize and structure the software\n",
    "- Key rules to look out:\n",
    "  - **Responsibilities**\n",
    "    - Define different actions that the program should do, and _each class will perform each action or responsibility_ .\n",
    "  - **Independece**\n",
    "    - Create each class as independent as possible, and give it certain \"power\" over the system\n",
    "  - **Behaviors**\n",
    "    - Define the simpliest possible what each class can do, and how does it interact with other classes. This will be the public interface\n",
    "#### CRC (Class-Responsibility-Collaborator) cards\n",
    "- These are cards that define the **responsibilities** (actions) and **collaborators** (classes with whom interact) of a class.\n",
    "  - Is a way to design classes that makes sure there is a limited number of actions and collaborators for each class.\n",
    "- Then, **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** takes part, and it is a _class diagram_ defining the **fields** (variables) and **methods**\n",
    "![UML card](UML.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2 Pseudo-Code\n",
    "- **Pseudo-Code** type of elaborated text that explains the functionality of a function\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.3 Coding Styles and Documentation\n",
    "- Pep is the officile Guide of coding style in Python\n",
    "- Identation usually are made of 4 blank spaces\n",
    "- Identifiers\n",
    "  - Classes should be single **nouns**, written with **CamelCase**\n",
    "  - Functions and methods should be in **lower letters**, and words separated with **underscores**\n",
    "  - Variables --> lower, underscore separated\n",
    "  - Constant values --> UpperCase, with underscores as separators\n",
    "- Comments\n",
    "  - Inline comments --> **#...**\n",
    "  - Block comments --> **\"\"\"...\"\"\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Documentation\n",
    "- Documentation of a function, class or module is done by **adding text as the first statement of the object at hand**. This automatically turns into a field of the object that can be accessed with the command help(x)\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2.3.4 Test and debugging\n",
    "- Test and debugging can be the most time-demandant activity when developing code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing\n",
    "- **Testing** means to prove how the program develops with differents inputs, and how each component and their relationship work\n",
    "- **Top-down**\n",
    "  - The **higher-level components** (those which depend on others) are tested first, replacing the lower-level with **stubs** , which somehow replace what the actual components do\n",
    "- **Bottom-up**\n",
    "  - The **lower-level components** (those which have the minimum amount of connections and dependencies) are tested first\n",
    "  - This is called **_Unit testing_** , as it test each **unit isolated** of the large complete system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging\n",
    "- Debug consists on analyzing how the program works **while it is running**\n",
    "  - This is useful to _fix the errors_\n",
    "- **print** statements --> SUPER BASICS\n",
    "- **debugger**, specialized environments in which to run the code, which stops at determined **breakpoints**, and the components can be accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Class Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.1 Example: CreditCard class\n",
    "- Class are defined with the `class` keyword, and the structure is an **indented block**\n",
    "- The `self` keyword is very important, and it references to the **\"owner\"** of the method being called\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The constructor\n",
    "- The constructor, `__init__` is executed when instantiating a class, and it defines the **state of an instance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation\n",
    "- Naming instance members with underscores makes them **nonpublic**, meaning that users shoud not be able to **access those variables**\n",
    "- We can provide **getters methods** and **setters methods** to access and modify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional methods\n",
    "- `make_payement` and `charge` are setters methods\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Errors\n",
    "- Our class should be more robust, think of what happens when calling `my_instance.charge(\"andy\")` It is an obvious error, and we have to be able to catch other exceptions, like `my_instance.charge(-399)`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the class\n",
    "- To test the class we used **method coverage**, looping through instances of the class"
